# Local Installation of LibreChat with Docker

For most scenarios, Docker Compose is the recommended installation method due to its simplicity, ease of use, and reliability.

## Prerequisites

- [`Git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

---

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up LibreChat with the default configuration:

```bash filename="Clone the Repository"
git clone https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat.git
```

```bash filename="Navigate to the LibreChat Directory"
cd LibreChat
```
#### Config (librechat.yaml) File

Next, we create the [LibreChat Config file](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml), AKA `librechat.yaml`, allowing for customization of the app's settings as well as [custom endpoints](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/ai_endpoints).

Whether or not you want to customize the app further, it's required for the `deploy-compose.yml` file we are using, so we can create one with the bare-minimum value to start.

You will enter the editor screen, and you can paste the following:

```yaml
# For more information, see the Configuration Guide:
# https://docs.librechat.ai/install/configuration/custom_config.html

# Configuration version (required)
version: 1.0.5
# This setting caches the config file for faster loading across app lifecycle
cache: true
```

```bash filename="Create a .env File from .env.example"
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Note:** **If you're using Windows, you might need to use `copy` instead of `cp`.**

```sh filename="Start LibreChat"
docker compose up -d
```

<Callout type="success" title="Access LibreChat!" emoji="ðŸŽ‰">
  **Visit [http://localhost:3080/](http://localhost:3080/)**
</Callout>

## Update LibreChat

The following commands will fetch the latest LibreChat project changes, including any necessary changes to the docker compose files, as well as the latest prebuilt images.

> **Note:** you may need to prefix commands with sudo according to your environment permissions.

```bash filename="Stop the running container(s)""
docker compose down
```

```bash filename="Pull latest project changes"
git pull
```

```bash filename="Pull the latest LibreChat image""
docker compose pull
```

```bash filename="Start LibreChat"
docker compose up
```
